# Netflix-switch

An electronic schematic and PCB layout for a the lighting array of a Netflix Switch. This PCB is part of a tutorial series where I implement a version of the [original switch](http://makeit.netflix.com/the-switch) myself.

The tutorial series in is 3 parts, [parts 1](https://tomasbasham.co.uk/product%20design/2016/05/12/netflix-and-chill.html), [parts 2](https://tomasbasham.co.uk/product%20design/2016/05/15/netflix-and-chill-part-2.html), and [parts 3](https://tomasbasham.co.uk/product%20design/2016/06/10/netflix-and-chill-part-3.html) and goes through prototyping to assembling the switch using this PCB.

## Printing

The easiest possible way to get a copy of this board printed is to have a PCB fabrication house do it for you. I have had an amazing experience using [OSH Park](https://oshpark.com/) and highly recommend them. Simply upload the compressed gerber files to the website and they will print and ship them to you.
